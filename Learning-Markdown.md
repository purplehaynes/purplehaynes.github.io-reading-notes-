Though only a couple days in this bootcamp has taught me so much about markdown and how to apply it in an easy and unique way. At
first glance, markdown can seem a bit daunting and intimidating to learn. 

However, it's quite easy to apply and make different words **bold** or *italic* or even ***BOTH***!

What is Markdown though, you may ask. According to it's creators it is basically 
>a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editon.

English, Kyle. In English, please.

Ok, ok, apologies. Markdown can be used for everything! People often use it to
1. create websites
2. doctuments
3. notes and books
4. presentations
5. and technical documentation

Files containing text in a Markdown-format can be opened using virtuatlly any application!
(Another couple examples of using markdown are listed directly above; making lists and quoting!)

You can even create different sized fonts for headings like

# A Main Heading,

## A Sub-heading,

###### Smaller Bullet-Point Type Headings!

An example of how to make these headings like this is with the \#\ symbol! I made the headings above is like this:
\# A Main Heading,\
\## A Sub-heading,\
\###### Smaller Bullet-Point Type Headings!\
