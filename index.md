## A Growth Mindset

In the word of Steve Haffenden, a growth mindset:

> believes ones fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort.

##### Our approach to specific issues and bumps along the learning journey can directly affect our growth as individuals. Such as 
*how we approach obstacles and challenges, apply effort, and take criticism all play into the outcome of our individual growth.*

Some ways I plan to maintain a grouwth mindset are 
- Maintain an open mind when getting contructive criticism
- Make sure I apply myself and learn at least once a day 
- Embrace challenges as they come and learn from my shortcomings.

***Maintaining these growth approaches and efforts are what will make or break any path I go down.***
