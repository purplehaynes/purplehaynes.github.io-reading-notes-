# HTML and Wireframing

## What is a Wireframe?

- Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers that allows them to plan the layout and design of a website, app, or product.
- Let's you plan the layout and interaction of the interface.
- A commonly used argument for wireframing is that if a user doesn't know where to go on a plain hand-drawn diagram of the site page, it is irrelevant what colors or fancy texts are used.

# HTML

## What is HTML?

- Stands for "Hypertext Markup Language"
- It is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content

### Anatomy of an HTML Element

`<p>Your cat is oddly shaped.</p>`

- _Opening Tag:_ This consists of the element `<p>` (paragraph element) which is wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins.
- _Closing Tag:_ The same as the opening tag, but it includes a _forward slash_ before the element name `</p>`. This states where the element ends.
- _The Content:_ "Your cat is oddly shaped." - This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
- _The Element:_ The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

### Anatomy of an HTML Document

- Headings- Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings
  > `<h1>My main title</h1>`
- Paragraphs- `<p>` elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content:
  > `<p>This is a single paragraph</p>`
- Lists
  - Unordered lists- are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a `<ul>` element.
  - Ordered lists- lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an `<ol>` element.
  - Each item inside the lists is put inside an `<li>` (list item) element.
- Links- To add a link, we need to use a simple element — <a> — "a" being the short form for "anchor".
